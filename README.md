### Project title
Udacity Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program Investigate a Relational Database

### Description
In this project, I'll query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, I'll be
querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. To assist the queries ahead, the schema for the DVD Rental database is provided.

The DVD rental database represents the business processes of a DVD rental store. The DVD rental database has many objects including:

- 15 tables
- 1 trigger
- 7 views
- 8 functions
- 1 domain
- 13 sequences
