Question 1: We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music. Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

SELECT f.title,
       c.name,
       COUNT(r.rental_id)
  FROM film_category fc
  JOIN category c
    ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
  JOIN film f
    ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
  JOIN inventory i
    ON i.film_id = f.film_id
  JOIN rental r
    ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
 WHERE c.name
    IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
GROUP BY 1,
         2
ORDER BY 2, 1


Question 2: Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.

SELECT f.title,
       c.name,
       f.rental_duration,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
  FROM film_category fc
  JOIN category c
    ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
  JOIN film f
    ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
 WHERE c.name 
    IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
ORDER BY 3


Question 3: Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:
A. Category
B. Rental length category
C. Count

SELECT t1.name,
       t1.standard_quartile,
       COUNT(t1.standard_quartile)
  FROM (SELECT f.title,
               c.name,
               f.rental_duration,
               NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
          FROM film_category fc
          JOIN category c
            ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
          JOIN film f
            ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
         WHERE c.name 
            IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')) t1
GROUP BY 1,
         2
ORDER BY 1, 2


Question 4: We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, and what was the amount of the monthly payments. Can you write a query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers?

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', p.payment_date) pay_month, 
       CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS full_name, 
       COUNT(p.amount) AS pay_countpermon, 
       SUM(p.amount) AS pay_amount
  FROM customer c
  JOIN payment p
    ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
 WHERE c.customer_id 
    IN (SELECT t1.cust
          FROM (SELECT c.customer_id cust, 
                       SUM(p.amount) as amount_total
                  FROM customer c
                  JOIN payment p
                    ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
              GROUP BY 1  
              ORDER BY 2 DESC
                 LIMIT 10) t1) 
   AND (p.payment_date BETWEEN '2007-01-01' AND '2008-01-01')
GROUP BY 2, 
         1
ORDER BY 2, 1, 3
